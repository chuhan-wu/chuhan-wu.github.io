                                  <strong>Introduction:</strong><br>
                                    <p>
                                     We think most kids enjoy drawing, but drawing beautiful images by hands is not easy for them. Plus, when kids draw with marker pens on physical papers, most of the time, they would accidentally draw on tables, their clothes, or dirty their hands. That mess would bother parents to clean them up and take a long time to erase those difficult marks. As the reason, Magic Cube aims to lead kids to enjoy the fun part of the drawing and easily paint beautiful water ink images with their creativity on the computer screen
                                    </p>
                                </div>

                                    <p> by placing cubes on an acrylic board.
 No marker pens or difficult color left on children’s clothes or furniture at home. It will save the ton of time for parents to clean up their children’s painting stuff. Painting with Magic Cube on computers also is convenient for parents to print out their children’s drawing. Even though, the user kids may not have much painting experience, the toy is designed to train kids’ artistic talents and visual creativity in the easiest way.                  </p>

                                      Before getting this idea of Magic Cube, we researched online, and found out an
interactive artwork, called Reactable. Reactable is an interactive remixed musical instrument, and made by research team at Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona. It was first presented by Sergi Jorda, Gunter Geiger, Martin Kaltenbrunner, and Marcos Alonso at a public concert of the International Computer Music Conference 2005 in Barcelona. Later on, in 2009, the company of Reactable System started the further development of this instrument with unlimited possibilities. In Reactable, the research team aims to create an interactive musical
instrument for users directly and easily controlling this instrument with several acrylic cubes. In order to make a computer to read the patterns, they set up a camera on the top of the screen. By placing different cubes on the top of a screen table, the program will sense the different patterns on each cube to change the musical speed, tone, and beat. Traditional remix musical software with multiple bottoms and switches is usually too complicated for people to apply well at the first time. However, this project by Sergi Jorda’s research team expands more creativity and possibility for wider audiences to directly control this musical instrument, and the concept of reactive become more user-friendly for people to manipulate the software. <br />
Another part of Magic Cube’s idea is from Ivan Sutherland’ s computing artwork, called Sketchpad, which was developed in 1963 at MIT’s Lincoln Labs.

                                </div>

                                <div class="one_half last">
                                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                    <p> With Ivan Sutherland’s Sketchpad, people can draw geometric shapes and easily change their positions on the computer screen by clicking bottoms. <br>
                                      In the period, the project was considered the pioneer of computing digital graphic, and it breaks the traditional way to paint with pen and paper, but instead, users use computing program to directly and interactively painting with a computer. <br/>

                                      Because of the inspirations from Reactable and Sketchpad, we had our initial idea of creating an interactive and user - friendly painting toy for kids and beginners, which is called Magic Cube. Compared to the last transducer project, our team set up a challenge to the toy design with 3D laser cutting which we did not use before. In the Magic Cube, we prepare two colors of acrylic cubes, and the two cubes have different patterns, which symbolize diverse painting styles. Also, we used laser cutting to make a board. There are nine squares on the board for users to place the two cubes. For increasing more painting possibilities and the level of interesting for kids, each square has four screws, and there are two ways to place cubes on each square. Totally, there are eighteen circuits on the board for kids to draw eighteen images. Once, kids place any cube on the square rightly, the circuit will be connected to make the images appear on the computer screen. To sum up, the main component of Magic Cube is to inverse the idea that drawing by hands, but kids can simply place cubes on right position of squares to paint beautiful images.                                </p>
                                </div>
                                <div class="one_half">
                                  <strong>The System:</strong><br>
                                    <p>
                                      For the image style setting, we used Adobe Photoshop and illustration to create the
  eighteen images. The first step to painting images is to paint variable brushes on a blank paper, and scan them into PDF files. In this processing, our team created nearly one hundred water brushes. After converting them to two PDF files, we opened them with Adobe Photoshop and adjusted its color into the black and white tone. Selected couple brushes from the edited files and pasted the brushes on Adobe Illustration. Then dropped them into a brush library and continue the above steps for multiple time until updated all of the brush into the library. Since the brush library was created well, that is the time to start painting images with Adobe Illustration. <br />
Our team chooses water ink and hand-drawing paintings because we want to combine classical painting with modern style technologies to accomplish Data Visualization. It is new to apply Classical Chinese Ink painting to the interactive touchpad. It is easier for beginners or people who are not familiar with this specific style of painting to interact with Asian Culture. Besides Chinese ink painting, we also include hand-drawing which enlarge the age range of customers, and enclose the distance between this product and young children.      </p>

    <p>
      The combination of Chinese ink painting and hand-drawing painting provides a more adaptive concept for consumers, and creates comprehensive feeling to people of all age range.The coding part, we combine Arduino and Processing together to achieve physical movement changing the image on the screen. We first imported Arduino Firmata library and serial library in Processing and then draw out the logic line in our toy. The most difficult part of coding is the buttons’ code. Since we want the image to move without showing its track, we need to refresh the background every time image moves. The problem is if we refresh the background, the image we placed before will also disappear and that is not what we want. In order to avoid this, we need to get a screenshot after image moves and use the latest screenshot as background every time. We also used a potentiometer to control the image size. Using the “scale” method could easily achieve this, but we correct the float read by the potentiometer to one decimal place otherwise the image will twinkle because of the unstable
      float.                                   </p>
