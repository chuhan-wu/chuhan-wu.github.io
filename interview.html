            The interview with Catherine Qiu, who is a representative of the second generation of immigrants who has had a hard time to adapt into neither American society or Chinese society. I intended to compare and contrast the cultural difference as well as discover the internal identity connection between the second generation of immigrants and native American citizens around them. During my process of observing facts, analyzing into an ethnography, preparing unbiased questions, interviewing the representative, and editing the recording into the podcast, I separated my idea of prohibiting snap-judgement on people’s identity and introduced people the life dilemma of the second generation of immigrants.

                                    <strong>Background: </strong><br>
                                    <p>
Qiu was born in Shaoguan, Canton Province of China in September 1998. She later immigrated to San Diego with her family in 2002, at the age of only 4 years old. As one of the second generation of immigrants, Qiu happened to grow up and receive education in San Diego----a relatively multicultural city filled by immigrants from all over the world.  I chose to interview Qiu because she has the characteristics of the second generation of immigrants and represents this group of people in society. The second generation of immigrants is the group of people who immigrated to the United States with their parents while they were young and did not participate in the decision making of immigrating to the United States.
<br>                              </p>
                                </div>

                                <div class="one_half last">
                                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>
    Similar to people with the same background, Qiu has good English speaking skill, as well as the ability to pronounce individual words and understand partial conversation in her home language, and hardly visits her hometown city. She has characteristics of Americans, such as being outgoing and innovative, and also an outlook of Chinese that she inherited from her parents. According to the Podcast Snap Judgment, people possibly make wrong decisions and offend people with their assumption and subjective judgment (Snap Judgement 11: 30). In order to avoid hurting my interviewee’s feeling, I should avoid leading questions that are simply based on my surface observations and offer appropriate attitudes and reactions to her responses.
</p>
                                </div>

                                <div class="one_half">
                                  <strong>Reflection:</strong><br>
                                    <p>
From my observation of the social circle of the second generation of immigrants, people like Qiu usually hang out with a group who has the same background and cultural identity. E.D Hirsch said that people would choose to become a part of the majority instead of being separated, which is a reason of human beings are social animals and need support from their communites (Takaki 3). People who are the second generation of immigrants have no significant connections with neither American society with mostly White, nor their home country society that they have hardly been to. As a result, they are in between of two societies and are willing to share their opinions with people who are also second generation of immigrants and experience the same with them. Therefore, people may face difficulties while they are trying to adapt to the society of another race and feel more comfortable staying with people who share the same cultural and historical background. In the ethnography of the second generation of immigrants,
                                    </p>
                                </div>

                                <div class="one_half last">
                                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                    <p> I will focus on the racial issues that affect immigrants’ lives, and the relationship between native citizens and people who are originally from another country like Qiu. <br> Even though the second generation of immigrants moved to the United States when they were young, there are still connections between them and the homeland they came from. Coulthard states in his book Place Against Empire that people have special emotion to their homeland because of the influences of culture and environment (Coulthard 81). Although Qiu grew up in the environment of the United States, her parents, who received their education and grew up in China, might affect her based on their traditional opinions. Thus, Qiu’s opinions about Chinese culture and tradition will provide me a clear understanding of whether and how the second generation of immigrants who grow and study in America are influenced by their parents.                 </p>
