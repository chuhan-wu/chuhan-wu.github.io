                <i>    In the past few weeks, there was a new policy being applied in Chinese social media such as Weibo(Blog), Chinese Twitter, and WeChat, that all words that have the connection to LGBTQ will be blocked automatically and the comment area was even closed for users. People are shocked by the new policy and turned into a great protest and speak for LGBTQ in not only Mainland China, but also all over the world.  </i><br>

                                    <p>
I always believe that people who are LGBTQ have more kindness compare to rest of people since they have faced more malevolence from the society, especially in China, which is more inflexible and having a low acceptance rate of LGBTQ. People of LGBTQ talk gentle and use their words carefully to avoid hurting others’ feeling with language. They care more about others because they desire the equal respect in return. Publish of the new policy absolutely hurt the feeling of LGBTQ, and my project is to demonstrate the difficult situation of this group in Chinese Society and to encourage them to become strong and proud.
<br>                              </p>
                                </div>

                                    <p>
     A famous scholar who studied LGBTQ in China, Beichuan Zhang, told in an interview on TV that people considered giving birth to children is the only purpose of love and having sex in our culture. People consider ignorance as naive, fatuity as virtue, and prejudice as principle. Love should be an attitude from the soul instead of a reaction to the organ (Seeing, Chapter 5). I am personally not an LGBTQ, but I will always stand behind them and support them fighting for equal right and respect.

                                        Through VR, the project displays multiple layers that contain different meaning. Above the background of a 360 view of the night with heavy fog, a black and white shadow of a city represents the cold relationship between people and the negative mood of the city in the eye of LGBTQ. In the middle of the image of 360 degrees, there is a bright light shining behind the city and penetrating buildings and forest. The bright light reflects a rainbow that approaches from the city to our face, which represents a long and colorful road in the bland world to approach equal right and respect of LGBTQ in the future. Above the layer of the rainbow, a sentence printed in white stand out of the bland background and state the main idea of the VR project. “You will see a rainbow after the rain,” tells the difficult situation faced by LGBTQ in Chinese society and the unfair treatment and discrimination they received. The sentence also encourages them to stand firm and look forward the bright future that all sexual orientations will be treated equally and with full respect.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                    <p> On the top of the 360-degree image is a layer of the 3D raindrop to imitate a heavy rain in the city. The raindrop layer covers all parts of the project to demonstrate the difficulty that prevents our society from being equal and tolerant of all sexual orientations.
    I add the song, King and Beggar, into the VR project to emphasize the main theme of rejecting discrimination toward LGBTQ in Chinese society. King and Beggar is one of the very few Chinese songs for LGBTQ in China, which expresses the idea of “Love is Love, and it will across all boundaries”. The song tells “I am a King with power to go against the whole world when I have you by my side, or I will become a beggar when I lose you” in Chinese. It demonstrates the power of love in front of people’s query and criticism and encourages LGBTQ to fight against discrimination and be proud and strong.                                 </p>
